## Brief description
We are talking about a snapshot of our universe in its infancy,
something like 379,000 years after the Big Bang, nothing compared to the estimated age of our universe.


The map above was taken by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and shows differences across the sky in
the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the radiant heat remaining from the Big Bang. The average
temperature is 2.73 degrees above absolute zero but the temperature is not constant across the sky. The fluctuations in the
temperature map provide information about the early universe. Indeed, as the universe expanded, there was a tug of war
between the force of expansion and contraction due to gravity. This caused acoustic waves in the hot gas, which is why there
are temperature fluctuations.
The strength of the temperature fluctuations f(x) at each frequency (or multipole) x is called the power spectrum and
this power spectrum can be used by cosmologists to answer cosmological questions. For example, the relative abundance
of different constituents of the universe (such as baryons and dark matter) corresponds to peaks in the power spectrum.
 the temperature map can be reduced to the following scatterplot of
power versus frequency:
